# HappyMenu
Web based, mobile friendly menu / recipe application with management UI

I need an application that can help my family decide what to cook for family, when no family member (especially my kids) has no idea to what to eat.

I hope this applicaiton is:
- Web based so any device with modern browser can use it
- Mobile friendly so I can confortablly use it on my phone
- With easy to use admin interface
- Hosted on Azure as Web App
- Tailoered to Azure Blob storage for its image hosting
- Containerized
- Set to be build / deployed by Azure DevOps
- Work as a test field for my full stack development skills

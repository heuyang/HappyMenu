# HappyMenu
Web based, mobile friendly menu / recipe application with management UI

I need an application that can help my family decide what to cook, when no family member (especially my kids) has idea on what to eat. And help making meal plans to somehow relax kitchen work and shopping list maintenance.

I hope this applicaiton is:
- Web based so any device with modern browser can use it
- Mobile friendly so I can confortablly use it on my phone
- With easy to use admin interface
- Hosted on Azure as Web App
- Tailoered to Azure Blob storage for its image hosting
- Containerized
- Set to be build / deployed by Azure DevOps
- Work as a test field for my full stack development skills
- Using Atlassian Jira to manage it's requirements of new features or bugs

Technologies to be used
- .net 6 or 7?
- C#
- Entity Framework Core
- Web APIs
- Azure Auth
- Azure SQL
- React
- Typescript
- XUnit
- TDD
